/**
 * Attaches a unique Correlation ID to every incoming request.
 *
 * The ID is sourced (in order of priority):
 *   1. `X-Correlation-ID` request header (forwarded by API gateways / clients).
 *   2. `X-Request-ID` (common alternative header name).
 *   3. A fresh UUID v4 generated per request.
 *
 * The resolved ID is:
 *   - Stored on `req.correlationId` for downstream handlers.
 *   - Echoed back in the `X-Correlation-ID` response header so clients
 *     can correlate their request with server logs.
